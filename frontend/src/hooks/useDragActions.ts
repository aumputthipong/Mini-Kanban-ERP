/**
 * @dnd-kit handlers for the board's drag-and-drop. Three concerns:
 *
 *   1. **Cross-column preview** during drag — moves the card optimistically in
 *      the store on `dragOver` so the user sees it land. A `useRef` tracks the
 *      last column we moved into so we don't keep re-firing the move on every
 *      pointer event (would loop with React's update cycle).
 *
 *   2. **Final commit** on `dragEnd` — recomputes the final position from the
 *      midpoint of the over-card to decide before/after placement, applies it
 *      locally, then broadcasts `CARD_MOVED` over WS. The server is the source
 *      of truth: if it rejects the move it broadcasts the corrected state and
 *      everyone (including this client) reconciles via `moveCard`'s
 *      idempotent semantics.
 *
 *   3. **Position math** is delegated to `utils/boardPosition` which uses the
 *      64k-gap strategy described in `docs/DATABASE.md` so reorders stay cheap.
